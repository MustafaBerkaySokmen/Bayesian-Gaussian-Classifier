# Bayesian-Gaussian-Classifier
The Bayesian Gaussian Classifier is a Python-based machine learning project that classifies data points using Bayesian decision theory. It estimates class priors, means, and covariances to compute posterior probabilities and assigns class labels accordingly. The project includes visualizations for decision boundaries.
